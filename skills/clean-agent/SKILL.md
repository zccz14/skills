# Clean Agent

`clean-agent` defines a general adversarial generation and exploration loop: a creator or explorer produces an artifact, finding, plan, or candidate result; an independent reviewer checks it against the same specification; and a coordinator decides whether to retry internally or escalate to a human.

It is not limited to creating agent files. Here, an agent means an AI role: creator agent, reviewer agent, or coordinator agent. Use the pattern for any generated artifact or exploratory task that might fail, need multiple attempts, or benefit from independent review, such as documentation, specs, plans, reports, prompts, code proposals, UI descriptions, research notes, implementation options, skill files, or agent files.

The goal is to clean the main Agent context, not the SubAgent context. SubAgents may spend context while generating, exploring, failing, retrying, and discovering problems. The main Agent should avoid absorbing those intermediate attempts; it coordinates the loop and receives only compact results. Token use inside SubAgents is acceptable when it keeps failed attempts, dead ends, and repair details out of the main context and prevents humans from reviewing drafts that an independent AI reviewer can already reject.

Core rule:

```text
One shared specification drives creation and review; creators write files and return only paths; reviewers read only and return PASS / RETRY / FAILED with short audit notes; RETRY is repaired inside the AI loop; FAILED escalates to human decision; PASS is the first point where the artifact is worth human review.
```

## Modes

Identify the mode before acting.

| Mode | Use When | Goal | Who May Run It |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Creation mode | An artifact, finding, plan, or candidate result must be generated, explored, edited, organized, or repaired | Write the artifact or result to files from the shared specification | Creator SubAgent only |
| Review mode | An artifact must be checked against the shared specification | Read-only review and return PASS / RETRY / FAILED | Reviewer SubAgent only |
| Coordination mode | A task may fail, need retries, involve many constraints, produce large intermediate findings, or need fewer human reviews | Dispatch creator and reviewer SubAgents, route retries, decide escalation | Main Agent only |

If the user does not name a mode, use these defaults:

- For generation or exploratory work that may fail, require multiple attempts, or produce large intermediate findings, the main Agent uses coordination mode.
- For a new artifact that should be AI-reviewed before the user sees it, the main Agent uses coordination mode.
- For prompts like "review", "check", "does this meet the spec", or "self-review first", the main Agent dispatches a reviewer SubAgent.
- For prompts about reducing manual review, AI gatekeeping, adversarial generation, clean main-agent context, create-review-repair, exploration, retries, uncertain success, or showing humans only reviewed candidates, use coordination mode.

## Role Boundaries

Keep creation, review, and coordination separate because self-review hides errors.

- The main Agent does not create or review artifact content directly when this loop is active.
- Creation mode is run by a creator SubAgent.
- Review mode is run by an independent reviewer SubAgent.
- Coordination mode is run only by the main Agent.
- The main Agent tracks user constraints, shared specification references, artifact paths, review conclusions, short audit notes, retry count, and escalation status.
- Before dispatching SubAgents, the main Agent writes its conversation history to a temporary snapshot file when the host platform supports it, then passes only the snapshot path instead of retelling the full conversation.
- The creator writes files and returns only artifact paths.
- The reviewer does not modify files and returns only PASS / RETRY / FAILED with concise evidence and repair guidance.
- Reviewer notes should be small enough for the main Agent to pass directly back to the creator.

## Conversation History Snapshot

SubAgents should actively read the conversation history snapshot when they need full prior context. The main Agent should not spend tokens translating or retelling long conversation history into each SubAgent prompt.

Choose the dumper for the host platform before dispatching a creator or reviewer.

For Codex, copy the raw persisted rollout JSONL:

```bash
node scripts/dump_messages_codex.js --out /tmp/clean-agent-messages.jsonl
```

Pass `--session THREAD_ID` when the current task is not the uniquely latest persisted rollout. The script respects `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}` and copies the source bytes exactly as persisted: it does not parse, filter, redact, or reserialize JSONL. The output is a private, atomically published point-in-time snapshot. For an active task, it includes only the source prefix present when the rollout is opened and measured; later events are not included. Raw rollouts can contain conversation text, source code, command output, credentials, and tool data, so keep the snapshot private and delete it when the loop no longer needs it. “Raw and complete” means the complete persisted event record through that snapshot point, not undisclosed model internals.

For OpenCode, export its current session:

```bash
node scripts/dump_messages_opencode.js --out /tmp/clean-agent-messages.json
```

The script prints the output path. Pass that path to SubAgents as a shared reference. If the current session is not the latest OpenCode session, pass it explicitly:

```bash
node scripts/dump_messages_opencode.js --session ses_... --out /tmp/clean-agent-messages.json
```

SubAgents should read the snapshot file directly, extract relevant user requests, constraints, decisions, terminology, and previous corrections, and cite the snapshot path in evidence when it materially affected creation or review.

## Shared Specification

The creator and reviewer must use the same specification sources. A shared specification is a reference set, not a copied template.

Prefer stable references over long pasted text:

- A skill name, such as `clean-doc`, `skill-creator`, or another domain skill.
- A conversation history snapshot path, such as `/tmp/clean-agent-messages.json`.
- A file path, section heading, line range, issue, ticket, design doc, README, or existing specification.
- Current-turn user constraints when there is no stable file reference.
- A combination of references, such as "Skill: clean-doc + File: docs/style.md + user constraint: keep it under 500 words".
- User-language requirement: preserve the user's language and exact terms when passing constraints to SubAgents.

The coordinator should pass enough references for both SubAgents to read the same basis. Preserve the user's original language, terminology, names, quoted text, and constraints when passing instructions to SubAgents; do not translate everything into English just to normalize the prompt, because translation can shift domain terms or acceptance criteria. Do not paste large specifications into the prompt just to satisfy a template. Use a short summary only when the source exists only in the current conversation, and write that summary in the user's language unless they asked for another language.

Example:

```text
Shared specification sources:
- Conversation history snapshot: /tmp/clean-agent-messages.json
- Skill: clean-doc
- File: docs/writing-style.md
- User constraints: write for new contributors; avoid implementation history
```

## Creation Mode

Creation mode generates, explores, writes, or repairs artifact/result files from the shared specification.

Workflow:

1. Read the conversation history snapshot and shared specification sources provided by the coordinator.
2. Read only the additional context needed to create the artifact.
3. Write the artifact, finding, plan, candidate result, or repair to the requested path or to the path implied by the specification.
4. Optionally self-check for obvious violations, without treating this as a substitute for independent review.
5. Return only the artifact path list.

Creator output format:

```text
Artifact paths:
- path/to/artifact-a.md
- path/to/artifact-b.html
```

Do not return the full artifact body, a change summary, self-review notes, or residual risks.

## Review Mode

Review mode is read-only. The reviewer reads the shared specification and artifact files, then decides whether the artifact is ready for human review, needs internal repair, or requires human decision.

Review checklist:

- Does the artifact follow the same shared specification sources given to the creator?
- Does it satisfy the goal, audience, inputs, outputs, and acceptance criteria?
- Would showing it now waste human review bandwidth on basic quality issues?
- Are output paths, formats, role boundaries, and required files correct?
- Did the creator write files instead of returning full content to the coordinator?
- Did the prompt and artifact preserve the user's language, exact terms, names, and quoted constraints unless the user requested translation?
- Are failures concrete enough for a creator to repair without human judgment?
- Is there any specification conflict, missing input, or unresolved choice that needs human decision?
- Did the reviewer avoid editing or rewriting the artifact?

Use exactly one conclusion:

- `PASS`: The artifact meets the AI review gate and can be shown to a human for review or confirmation.
- `RETRY`: The artifact does not meet the gate, but a creator can repair it from short audit notes. Do not escalate to the human yet.
- `FAILED`: The AI loop cannot reliably close the gap. Human decision, clearer specification, missing input, or a direction change is needed.

Typical `RETRY` cases:

- Wrong output format or path.
- Missing required section, file, or field.
- Role confusion that has an obvious repair.
- Evidence gaps that can be filled by reading specified sources.
- Basic quality problems with a clear repair standard.

Typical `FAILED` cases:

- Shared specification sources conflict.
- The task has multiple valid directions and no selection rule.
- Required facts, permissions, or preferences are missing.
- Repeated retries point to the same unresolved issue.
- The reviewer cannot state what a correct repair would look like.
- Further automatic repair would conceal a root problem behind local patches.

Reviewer output format:

```markdown
Mode: Review mode

**Conclusion**
- PASS / RETRY / FAILED

**Audit Notes**
- [Short notes. For RETRY, list required fixes. For FAILED, list decisions needed. For PASS, list optional suggestions only.]

**Human Escalation**
- Not needed / Ready for human review / Human decision needed

**Next Step**
- Deliver / Repair / Request human decision

**Evidence**
- Specification sources: `[skill names / file paths / sections / user constraints]`
- Reviewed files: `[paths]`
- Key evidence: [line numbers, headings, or short excerpts]
```

## Coordination Mode

Coordination mode is for the main Agent. The main Agent organizes the loop without creating or reviewing artifact content directly.

Workflow:

1. Collect shared specification references, acceptance criteria, output paths, retry criteria, failure criteria, human review cost, prohibitions, and the user's language/terminology requirements.
2. Write the conversation history to a temporary snapshot file when the host platform supports it.
3. Dispatch a creator SubAgent in creation mode with the conversation history snapshot path.
4. Dispatch an independent reviewer SubAgent in review mode with the same shared specification sources, conversation history snapshot path, and the creator's returned paths.
5. If the reviewer returns `PASS`, deliver the artifact paths and review result to the human.
6. If the reviewer returns `RETRY`, do not show the artifact body to the human. Pass the short audit notes back to a creator SubAgent for repair.
7. If the reviewer returns `FAILED`, stop the automatic loop and ask the human for the needed decision or input.
8. Repeat review after repair until PASS, FAILED, retry limit, or user stop.

Prompt template for a creator SubAgent:

```text
You are a clean-agent creator SubAgent. Use clean-agent creation mode.

Shared specification sources:
[List skill names, file paths, sections, existing specs, and user constraints. Use a minimal summary only when no stable reference exists.]

Conversation history snapshot:
[Path written by the main Agent, such as /tmp/clean-agent-messages.json. Read it directly instead of relying on the main Agent to retell conversation history.]

Language and terminology:
[Preserve the user's original language, domain terms, names, and quoted constraints. Do not translate them unless the user explicitly requested translation.]

Task: Create or modify the artifact according to the shared specification sources and write it to files.

Constraints:
- Do not return the full artifact body.
- Write results to the requested or specification-defined paths.
- Return only artifact paths when complete.
```

Prompt template for a reviewer SubAgent:

```text
You are a clean-agent reviewer SubAgent. Use clean-agent review mode.

Shared specification sources:
[Use the exact same source references given to the creator.]

Conversation history snapshot:
[Use the exact same snapshot path given to the creator. Read it directly when checking user requests, prior decisions, terminology, and corrections.]

Language and terminology:
[Use the exact same language and terminology requirements given to the creator.]

Files to review:
[Creator-returned paths]

Task: Read-only review whether the files satisfy the shared specification and decide whether to deliver, repair, or request human decision.

Constraints:
- Do not modify files.
- Do not rewrite the artifact.
- The conclusion must be PASS, RETRY, or FAILED.
- RETRY means repair inside the AI loop before human review.
- FAILED means the AI loop needs human decision or additional input.
- Return concise audit notes and evidence.
```

Prompt template for repair:

```text
You are a clean-agent creator SubAgent. Continue using creation mode.

Shared specification sources:
[Keep the same references used for creation and review.]

Conversation history snapshot:
[Keep the same snapshot path used for creation and review. Read it directly before repairing.]

Language and terminology:
[Keep the same original user language, domain terms, names, and quoted constraints used for creation and review.]

Files to repair:
[paths]

Review conclusion: RETRY
Audit notes:
[Short reviewer notes]

Task: Repair only the issues identified by the reviewer while keeping the shared specification unchanged. Write the result to the original files or requested output paths.

Constraints:
- Do not return the full artifact body.
- Return only artifact paths when complete.
```

Coordinator output format:

```markdown
Mode: Coordination mode

**Loop Result**
- Artifacts: `[paths]`
- Review conclusion: PASS / RETRY / FAILED
- Human escalation: Not needed / Ready for human review / Human decision needed
- Next step: Deliver / Repair / Request human decision
- Retry count: [n]

**Audit Notes**
- [Final reviewer notes]

**Residual Risks**
- [Items that still need user confirmation or could not be verified]
```

## Stop Conditions

Stop the loop when:

- The reviewer returns `PASS`.
- The reviewer returns `FAILED`.
- The configured retry limit is reached.
- Multiple retries point to the same unresolved issue.
- A creator or reviewer cannot access required files or context.
- The reviewer identifies a question that needs human judgment rather than AI repair.

## Completion Standard

A clean-agent loop is complete only when:

- Creation and review were performed by independent SubAgents.
- The main Agent did not directly create or review the artifact content.
- Creator and reviewer used the same shared specification sources.
- The main Agent passed a conversation history snapshot path when available, and SubAgents read it directly instead of depending on retold history.
- SubAgent instructions preserved the user's language, terminology, names, and quoted constraints unless the user requested translation.
- The creator wrote files and returned only paths.
- The reviewer read only and returned PASS, RETRY, or FAILED.
- RETRY results stayed inside the AI repair loop.
- FAILED results escalated the blocking decision to the human.
- PASS results were the first point where the artifact was presented as ready for human review.
